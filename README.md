# Data Analysis and Regression Modelling (San Francisco Salaries, 2010-2018)

## Overview
This project involves extensive data analysis on San Francisco salaries data from 2010 to 2018. The main objectives were to clean and preprocess the data, apply regression modeling techniques for salary prediction, and visualize the results using advanced data visualization tools.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
2. **Regression Modelling**
3. **Data Visualization**

## 1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and imputed missing values to ensure completeness of the dataset.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Detected outliers using statistical methods and treated them appropriately to maintain the integrity of the data.
- **Data Transformation**: Standardized and normalized the data where necessary to prepare it for analysis.

## 2. Regression Modelling
- **Predictive Modelling**: Built regression models to predict salaries based on various features.
- **Gender Analysis**: Applied classification techniques to analyze salary differences and make predictions based on gender.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## 3. Data Visualization
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating static, publication-quality visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: Utilized for making complex statistical plots.
- **Plotly**: Employed for interactive visualizations to explore data trends and insights.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing regression models and other machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive graphing and visualization.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Data**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean the dataset.
2. **Build Models**: Execute the regression modelling script to train and evaluate the models.
3. **Visualize Results**: Use the visualization script to generate and explore the visualizations.


## Results
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved high accuracy in salary predictions with minimal error rates.
- **Gender Insights**: Uncovered significant insights into salary disparities based on gender.
- **Visualization**: Created a series of interactive and static visualizations that effectively communicate the findings.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of data analysis, regression modelling, and data visualization techniques on a real-world dataset. The findings provide valuable insights into salary trends and disparities in San Francisco from 2010 to 2018.
